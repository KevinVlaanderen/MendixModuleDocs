# MendixModuleDocs

MendixModuleDocs is a small tool that mimics the documentation generation capabilities offered in Mendix Studio Pro, but with greated flexibility.

It uses the Mendix Model SDK to extract information from a Mendix model, which is then fed into a set of template to generate the required output, such as an .html document.
Filters can be applied to control which modules and documents should be processed.

MendixModuleDocs can be used as a standalone (node-based) CLI or as a library.
